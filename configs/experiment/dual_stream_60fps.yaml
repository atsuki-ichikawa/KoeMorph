# 60fps experiment configuration
defaults:
  - override /config

# Set frame rate to 60fps
frame_rate: 60

# Model overrides for 60fps
model:
  target_fps: 60
  # Double the mel sequence length to maintain same time window
  # 30fps: 256 frames = 8.53s

# Data overrides for 60fps  
data:
  target_fps: 60
  # Double window frames to maintain same time window
  window_frames: 512  # ~8.5 seconds at 60fps
  # Adjust stride for appropriate overlap
  initial_stride: 64  # Double of 30fps initial stride
  final_stride: 2     # Double of 30fps final stride
  
# Training adjustments for 60fps
training:
  # May need to adjust batch size due to increased sequence length
  batch_size: 2  # Reduced from 4 due to memory constraints
