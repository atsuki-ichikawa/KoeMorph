## Mathematical Formulations (for Technical Sections)

### Enhanced Dual-Stream Attention
```
Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QK^T / √d_k)V
Q_arkit = [q1, q2, ..., q52]  # ARKit blendshape queries

# Mel Stream (frequency-wise processing)
K_mel, V_mel = Encoder_mel(Mel_enhanced)  # Shape: (B×80, T, d_model)
A_mel = Attention(Q_arkit, K_mel, V_mel)

# Emotion Stream (temporal concatenation)  
K_emotion, V_emotion = Encoder_emotion(Emotion_concat)  # Shape: (B, T, d_model)
A_emotion = Attention(Q_arkit, K_emotion, V_emotion)

# Natural weighting (learned)
w_mel = softmax(θ_mel / τ)
w_emotion = softmax(θ_emotion / τ)
Output = w_mel ⊙ A_mel + w_emotion ⊙ A_emotion
```

### Information Density Ratio
```
R_info = D_mel / D_emotion
R_baseline = 20,480 / 88 = 232.7
R_enhanced = 20,720 / 256 = 80.9
Improvement = R_baseline / R_enhanced = 2.87x
```

### Multi-Frame Rate Dynamics
```
hop_length(fps) = sample_rate / fps
hop_length(30) = 16000 / 30 = 533 samples
hop_length(60) = 16000 / 60 = 267 samples

Frame_count(fps, duration) = duration × fps  
Context_frames(30fps) = 8.5 × 30 = 256 frames
Context_frames(60fps) = 8.5 × 60 = 512 frames
```
